I wouldn't recommend listening to the ones sang by the ones circling around the Blind Idiot HP Lovecraft reference. They are everything but pleasant."</p>

                <h2>Abdahul Narrates</h2>
                <p>"Well... I can always destroy the thing he worked so hard for in front of him if no one else does it. Either way I doubt it is anything good."

He sighed. He had just finished his tasks in this world and had already a whole load of them in front of him. He smiled a bit... one step at a time. One can't do everything at once. For now his focus will be finding Julia which shouldn't prove to difficult. 
                    
"No I got no questions. Just a goodbye and good luck. I will send pictures of where I visit." That last part of half a joke. He was going to ask something regarding her... stress but decided that was none of his business. 
                    
He turned around and began walking off and without looking he said, "Next time I will be the one trashing you at Smash whatever that was called, Sariel." 
                    
And with that he simply faded away, becoming a thing of the past, just like many other things. At least until his next visit.</p>
